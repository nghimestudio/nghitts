🧠 Model Training Details

This project is built on top of Piper TTS and fine-tuned using a custom dataset to generate realistic voices.

🔹 Base Model

Based on Piper (English checkpoint)

Lightweight, fast, and optimized for local inference

Designed for real-time speech generation

🔹 Fine-Tuning Process

Dataset size: ~1,000 audio samples

Voices: Multiple famous celebrity voices

Training method: Fine-tuning on existing Piper English checkpoint

Epochs: ~2,000 epochs

Audio preparation:

Cleaned and normalized audio

Matched text–audio pairs

Consistent sample rate

Noise removed

The model learns:

Voice tone

Accent

Speech rhythm

Natural pronunciation

⚡ Inference Method

Web-based inference

No server required

Runs fully locally

Very fast inference (~5× real-time speed)

Users can:

Enter text

Select a voice

Generate speech instantly
